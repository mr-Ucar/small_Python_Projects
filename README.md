BTW, in these kinds of promotion emails, there is a notion of _UTM_ which means:
 "Successful marketers use many tools to track and measure the effectiveness of their digital marketing campaigns, including Urchin Tracking Module (UTM) codes, which are snippets of code attached to the end of a URL. UTM codes are also used to pinpoint specific sources of traffic to a website."

### Project 2:
### FONO Audio Downloader
-This script will download audio files from a website called "Fono": https://fono.com.tr/seslendirmeler
-I have begun studying French and bought Books from "Fono" and this French course is aimed at Turkish speaking people.
-For pronunciations, instead of downloading the mp3 files by one by, I wrote this simple script.

-The script will ask you the download link for the podcast
-I kept the script simple, otherwise, it was more convenient to use a scraping library and automize the boring stuff:)

*Follow the URL: view-source:https://fono.com.tr/seslendirmeler*
_Find the Audio files which are mp3 formatted, in the Source code of the Website. You need to press *"Oynat"*, _Play_ to see the mp3 files, copy that URL and the script will download the audios by one by._
